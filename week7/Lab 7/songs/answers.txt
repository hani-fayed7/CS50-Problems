// Question
1- If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
// Answer
I think i could characterize their audio aura by creating a new table in sql named by the name of the listener, that has all the needed informations about this aura

// Question
2- Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
// Answer
...>SELECT name FROM songs WHERE energy = (SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs) AND valence = (SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs) AND danceability = (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs);
If we run this query we notice that nothing is shown in the output table, not because the query has syntax error or the like, but because it's not possible that a song has exactly the same value as the average energy and so on.
I purpose that we calculate this aura not by looking at the exact average values of energy, valence or danceability, but by greater than or equal the average of them.
this query could be typed as follows:
...>SELECT name FROM songs WHERE energy >= (SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs) AND valence >= (SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs) AND danceability >= (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs);
