Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: As i increased the number of simulations, i realised that as long as the number of simulations is small, the incorrect prediction would be.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would call the predictions "good enough" after 1000 simulations
